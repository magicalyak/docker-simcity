    <h3>SimCity Classic</h3>
    <p>SimCity, also known as Micropolis or SimCity Classic,[1] is a city-building simulation video game developed by Will Wright and released for a number of platforms from 1989 to 1991. 
       
       SimCity features two-dimensional graphics and an overhead perspective. 
       
       The objective of the game is to create a city, develop residential and industrial areas, build infrastructure, and collect taxes for further development of the city. Importance is placed on increasing the standard of living of the population, maintaining a balance between the different sectors, and monitoring the region's environmental situation to prevent the settlement from declining and going bankrupt. </p>
